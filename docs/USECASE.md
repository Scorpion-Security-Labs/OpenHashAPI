## Searching for Plaintext & Hashes
- The system can be used to store and manage various hashes and plaintext from
  different sources. Teams can use these to identify likely poor human
  passwords for offensive and defensive purposes.

## Super Potfile for Hash Cracking
- Ability to store hash and plaintext material in a data centric manner with
  the ability to enforce a proper authorization model surrounding access. This
  can be used to empower teams to make data centric decisions. With the ability
  to rehash items, a single algorithm can be maintained for optimized storage
  or multiple can be stored for every use case.

## Rules, Wordlist, & Metadata Database
- With the ability to reclaim metadata from entries, the server can directly
  add value back to security teams by generating likely wordlist, rules, and
  masks based on the input data. With quality filtering and validation, items
  are ensured to be high quality.

## Collaboration Framework for Hash Cracking
- With the ability to upload files, teams can work together when they find
  hashes on tests without uploading them to the central database. Files can be
  uploaded hashes which can be updated easily when valid plaintext's are found.
  Teams can also use this to pass around wordlists and rules and other
  temporary files.

## CTF & Ephemeral Usage
- With easy set up and deployment the server can be used for individual CTFs as
  well as for temporary usage. Users can select what gets persisted and the
  rest is wiped away when the infrastructure is removed.
